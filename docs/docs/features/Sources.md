## Types

Just like dataview, you can use multiple sources for your data :

1. **Current_folder**: this will match all files within the selected folder when creating the database. If you want to change the folder, just move the database to another folder ;
2. **Tag**: this will match all files with the given tag ;
3. **Incoming_link**: this will match all files that have links to the select file ;
4. **Outgoing_link**: this will match all files that have links from the select file ;
5. **Dataview**: you can put your dataview query (DQL) without the first line `TABLE columns` as the plugin will autocomplete this part. For example : `FROM "folder" WHERE column = "something" SORT column ASC`. Use this source if you want to combine multiple tags, links, or folders.

## Destination Folders

There are two types of destinations : 

1. Where you will store the database file ;
2. Where you will store the notes of the database.

If you chose `tag/incoming_link/outgoing_link/dataview` as the source, you'll have to choose both types of destinations. But if you right-clicked a folder or selected `current_folder` as the source, everything is stored under one folder, so you'll only choose once.
